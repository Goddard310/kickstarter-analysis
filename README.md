# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is trying to fund her play, Fever, and would like to understand the best way to approach a Kickstarter campaign.  Her costs are expected to be $12,000.  
### Purpose
Identify the likelihood of success, recommend a timeframe and offer insight into her $12,000 goal.  
## Analysis and Challenges
While Kickstarter campaigns generally have a 55% success rate, and theater projects are within 1 standard deviation of that at 58%, we can design the campaign to increase the likelihood of success.
