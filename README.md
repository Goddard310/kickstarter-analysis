# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is trying to fund her play, Fever, and would like to understand the best way to approach a Kickstarter campaign.  Her costs are expected to be $12,000.  
### Purpose
Identify the likelihood of success, recommend a timeframe and offer insight into her $12,000 goal.  
## Analysis and Challenges
While Kickstarter campaigns generally have a 55% success rate, and theater projects are within 1 standard deviation of that at 58%, we can design the campaign to increase the likelihood of success. 
One challenge is that the categories weren't a good determinant of success.  However, plays did have a slightly higher success rate of 61% so there is optimism for Louise's project.   
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- We defined Lauch Date by month
- May and June clearly had the highest success rates and should be targeted
- The winter months of Nov-Jan, and potentially Feb, should be avoided
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Clearly the lower goals had less success for plays, and those made up the bulk of the failed campaigns.  Above $5,000, the goal had little effect on the outcome of the campaign for plays.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As a new analyst, there were challenges with syntax, and this project took longer than one would expect.  I doubt Louise would be thrilled with the turnaround time.  
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter months considerably underperform summer months.  Holidays and alternative charitable giving are suspected reasons <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May and June are the best months to begin a campaign
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals under $5,000 have a much higher likelihood of failure <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no discernable drop-off after that.  Louise should be confident in her goal and potentially raise the number
- What are some limitations of this dataset? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data only assesses Kickstarter <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plays as a subcategory is a small sample 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outcome by duration <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include Live in the Successful calculations
